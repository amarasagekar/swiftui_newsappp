Here are the main features of the News App we'll build:
1. Fetch news based on categories: general, business, science, technology, health, entertainment, sports
2. Bookmark articles so it can be persisted even when the app restarts.
3. Share article using native iOS share sheet UIActivityController.
4. Read article inside a Safari WebView in modal sheet presentation.
5. Search news based on the search query you type on the search bar.
6. Recent search history list.
